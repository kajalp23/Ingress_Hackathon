# Digital Census 2021

An attempt to digitalize the process of one the World's biggest endeavours - The Indian Census of 2021.
We plan to optimise and digitise the process for easy input and hassle-free retrieval.

# Usage Guidelines:

>* The Surveyor goes door-to-door to collect the raw data and feed it to the system. We use a Web-App since its platform-independent and can work on every device.

The Analyst gets to fetch data using the required Queries to process the data.
